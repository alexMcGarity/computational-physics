[[Collider Physics]]
	Major Goal: Separating and classifying data
	basically needle in a haystack problem
[[Supervised Learning]] vs [[Unsupervised Learning]]
	supervised provides examples with labels
	unsupervised catagorizes data without instruction
[[Deep Learning]] vs [[Not Deep Learning]]
	Deep Learning: image processing, neural networks, convolutional filtering
	Not Deep Learning: Boosted Descision Tree, list of numbers + catagories
	Boosted Descision Tree: build new trees taking into account misclassified data
